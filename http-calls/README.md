In chapter 1 we learned what a CMS was and how it could be used to manage the content of your website. In this chapter we are going to take a look at how we can get this  information out of the system using a **Rest API**. To practise making these API calls we recommend downloading postman at https://www.postman.com.


A reference manual of the strapi  REST endpoints can be found here: https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/database-apis-reference/rest-api.html
